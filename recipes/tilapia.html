    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most popular types of fish in the United States because it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) Tilapia Fillets</li>
        <li>Salt and Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>½ Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, Melted</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Flat-Leaf Parsley</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.</li>
    </ol>
